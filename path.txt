Absolute Path: An absolute path provides the complete location of a file or directory from the root directory. It always starts from the root directory and includes all directories leading to the specific file or directory. This path is independent of the current working directory. For example, in a Unix-like system (linux), an absolute path might look like:

/home/user/documents/report.txt

In a Windows system, an absolute path might look like:

C:\Users\User\Documents\Report.txt



Relative Path: A relative path specifies a file or directory location relative to the current working directory. This type of path is useful when you want to refer to a location without needing the full path, making it more flexible and adaptable to different environments.

 For example, if your current working directory is /home/user, a relative path to the report.txt file might be:

documents/report.txt

In a Windows system, if the current directory is C:\Users\User, the relative path might be:

Documents\Report.txt
