Managing file permissions is an important task in maintaining the security and integrity of a system. It controls who can read, write, or execute a file, and it can be crucial for both system administration and collaborative environments. 



Types of File Permissions:-

In Unix-like operating systems, there are three types of file permissions:

1. Read (r) – Allows the user to open and view the contents of a file. 

2. Write (w) – Allows the user to modify the contents of a file or directory (i.
e., add, remove, or rename files in a directory).

3. Execute (x) – Allows the user to run a file as a program/script. For directories, it allows the user to access files in the directory.




NOTE:These permissions apply to three categories of users:

a. Owner (User): The user who owns the file.
b.Group: Users who are part of the file’s group.
c.Others: All other users on the system.




Viewing File Permissions: 

To view the current file permissions, use the ls -l command:

    Ex:- $ ls -l myfile.txt
    We get output:
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 user group 1234 Dec 4 14:32 myfile.txt

The output shows:

The first character (-) indicates it's a regular file (it would be d for a directory).
The next three characters (rwx) show the permissions for the owner (read, write, and execute).
The next three characters (r-x) show the permissions for the group (read and execute).
The last three characters (r-x) show the permissions for others (read and execute).        




Modifying File Permissions:

Permissions can be modified using the chmod command. There are two ways to set permissions: symbolic (using letters) and numeric (using numbers).
